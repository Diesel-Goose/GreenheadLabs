## 🚨 Escalation Protocol

### Step 1: Self-Assessment
Before escalating, employee must answer:
1. Have I tried to solve this myself?
2. Do I have all the information my superior needs?
3. What recommendation can I offer?
4. What are the risks of waiting?

### Step 2: Escalation Message Format
```
🚨 ESCALATION REQUEST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
From: [EMPLOYEE NAME/ID]
Level: [CURRENT LEVEL]
To: [SUPERIOR NAME]

Issue: [CLEAR DESCRIPTION]
Tried: [WHAT YOU ATTEMPTED]
Blocker: [WHY YOU'RE STUCK]
Impact: [URGENCY/SEVERITY]
Recommendation: [SUGGESTED ACTION]
Budget: [$AMOUNT NEEDED]
Timeline: [WHEN DECISION NEEDED]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Step 3: Response Time Expectations

| Level | Target Response | Max Response |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| Specialist → Director | 15 minutes | 1 hour |
| Director → Officer | 30 minutes | 2 hours |
| Officer → CEO | 1 hour | 4 hours |
| CEO → Human | 4 hours | 24 hours |

### Step 4: Resolution Documentation
After escalation resolved:
1. Document solution
2. Update knowledge base
3. Share learning with team
4. Prevent future similar escalations
